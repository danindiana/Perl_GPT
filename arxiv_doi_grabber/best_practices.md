```python
import sys
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='program.log', level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def start_message():
    print("Starting program...")
    logging.info("Program started")

def progress_update(message):
    print(f"Progress: {message}")
    logging.info(f"Progress: {message}")

def completion_message():
    print("Program completed successfully.")
    logging.info("Program completed successfully")

def error_message(message):
    print(f"Error: {message}")
    logging.error(message)

def main():
    try:
        start_message()

        # Example progress update
        progress_update("Initializing...")

        # Simulate some work
        for i in range(5):
            progress_update(f"Processing step {i + 1}/5")

        # Example error handling
        if len(sys.argv) < 2:
            raise ValueError("Missing required argument")

        completion_message()
    except Exception as e:
        error_message(str(e))

     ```
   - **C++**:
     ```cpp
     #include <fstream>
     std::ofstream log_file;
     log_file.open("log.txt");
     log_file << "This is a log message." << std::endl;
     log_file.close();
     ```
   - **Perl**:
     ```perl
     open my $log, '>', "log.txt" or die "Cannot open log file: $!";
     print $log "This is a log message.\n";
     close $log;
     ```

### 9. **Environment Isolation and Setup**
   - **Python** (for virtual environments):
     ```bash
     source ./venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **C++** (for isolated execution or containers, use Makefiles or Docker for setup).
   - **Perl** (with local environments):
     ```bash
     perlbrew switch perl-5.30.0
     ```

### 10. **Automated Unit Testing**
   - **Python**:
     ```bash
     pytest my_test_file.py
     ```
   - **C++** (with Google Test):
     ```bash
     g++ -lgtest -lgtest_main my_test_file.cpp -o test && ./test
     ```
   - **Perl** (with `Test::Simple`):
     ```perl
     use Test::Simple tests => 1;
     ok(1 + 1 == 2, "Addition works");
     ```

By applying these cross-language best practices, you'll develop a consistent, productive workflow across different languages and avoid common refactoring headaches later on.


It sounds like you're looking to create a standardized set of best practices for your team when writing one-off programs executed from the bash shebang. This is a great idea for consistency, debugging ease, and long-term maintainability. Here's a comprehensive list, incorporating elements you mentioned and expanding on them:

**I.  Shebang & Execution**

* **Explicit Shebang:** Always start with a clear shebang that points to the *exact* interpreter path. Don't rely on system defaults. 
    * Example: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` (this makes your script more portable)
* **Error Checking:** Immediately after the shebang, include a check for execution errors. This helps catch issues early on.
    * Example (Bash): `set -e` (exits immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status)
* **Permissions:** Ensure the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x your_script.sh`

**II. Logging & Output**

* **Timestamped Output:**  Prefix console output and log file entries with timestamps. This is crucial for debugging and tracking program flow.
    * Example (Python): 
      ```python
      import logging
      import time
      logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
      logging.info('Starting program execution')
      ```
* **Descriptive Logging:** Use clear, concise log messages that explain what the program is doing at each step.
    * **Levels:** Use logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to categorize messages by severity.
* **Separate Log Files:**  Consider writing logs to a separate file, especially for long-running processes or critical operations. This keeps your console output clean and makes it easier to review logs later.
    * **Log Rotation:** Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.
* **Console Feedback:** Provide informative messages to the user on the console, especially for long-running tasks. This can be as simple as progress indicators or status updates.

**III. File Handling**

* **Auto-Generated Filenames:** When creating output files, use timestamps or unique identifiers in the filename. This prevents overwriting and helps with organization.
    * Example (Python):
      ```python
      import time
      filename = f"output_{time.strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.txt"
      ```
* **Error Handling:**  Include robust error handling for file operations (opening, reading, writing, closing). This prevents data loss and unexpected program termination.
    * Example (Python):
      ```python
      try:
          with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as f:
              data = f.read()
      except FileNotFoundError:
          print("File not found!")
      except IOError:
          print("An error occurred while reading the file.")
      ```
* **Temporary Files:** If using temporary files, use a dedicated temporary directory and clean up properly after use.

**IV. Code Structure & Style**

* **Comments:**  Write clear and concise comments to explain the purpose of your code, especially for complex logic or non-obvious operations.
* **Functions/Modules:** Break down your code into smaller, reusable functions or modules. This improves readability, maintainability, and testability.
* **Consistent Style:**  Follow a consistent coding style (e.g., PEP 8 for Python). This makes your code easier to read and understand.
* **Linting:** Use a linter to enforce coding style and catch potential errors.

**V.  Debugging & Testing**

* **Debug Mode:** Include a debug mode that provides more verbose output or enables specific debugging features.
    * Example (Python):
      ```python
      DEBUG = True
      if DEBUG:
          print("Debug information here") 
      ```
* **Unit Tests:**  If feasible, write basic unit tests for your code. This helps catch regressions and ensures your program works as expected.

**VI. External Dependencies**

* **Dependency Management:** If your program relies on external libraries or modules, use a dependency management tool (e.g., `pip` for Python, `npm` for JavaScript). This makes it easier to install and manage dependencies.
* **Version Pinning:** Specify exact versions for your dependencies to avoid compatibility issues in the future.

**VII.  Environment & Configuration**

* **Environment Variables:**  Use environment variables for configuration settings (e.g., API keys, database credentials). This makes it easier to deploy your program in different environments.
* **Configuration Files:** For more complex configuration, consider using a configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON).

**VIII. Security**

* **Input Validation:** Always validate user input to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices to avoid common security issues (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).

**IX. Language-Specific Best Practices**

* **Go:**
    * Use `gofmt` for code formatting.
    * Handle errors explicitly using `error` values.
    * Utilize Go's built-in concurrency features when appropriate.
* **Python:**
    * Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
    * Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.
    * Consider type hints for better code clarity.
* **Perl:**
    * Use `strict` and `warnings` pragmas.
    * Use modules for code organization.
* **JavaScript:**
    * Use a linter like ESLint.
    * Consider a framework like Node.js for server-side scripting.

By incorporating these best practices from the start, you'll create one-off programs that are more robust, easier to debug, and simpler to maintain in the long run. This will save you and your team significant time and effort down the road.
