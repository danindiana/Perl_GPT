Elegant Kolmogorov complexity approximation for file size cleaning compared to the entropy of the corpus can be a bit complex, but we can break it down into a more practical approach. Kolmogorov complexity is a measure of the algorithmic complexity of a string, which is the length of the shortest program that can produce that string. However, directly calculating Kolmogorov complexity is undecidable in general. Instead, we can use entropy as a proxy for complexity, which is more practical for our purposes.

### Entropy as a Proxy for Complexity

Entropy in information theory measures the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a set of data. For text files, entropy can be used to approximate the complexity of the content. Higher entropy generally indicates more complex or random data.

### Steps to Approximate and Clean Files

1. **Calculate Entropy for Each File**: Calculate the entropy of each `.txt` file to approximate its complexity.
2. **Set a Threshold**: Define a threshold for entropy to distinguish between "valuable" and "unwanted" files.
3. **Clean Files Based on Entropy**: Remove files with entropy below the threshold.

### Calculating Entropy in Perl

Hereâ€™s a Perl script to calculate the entropy of a text file and remove files based on a threshold:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use File::Basename;
use List::Util qw(sum);

my $entropy_threshold = 3.5;  # Adjust this threshold based on your needs

sub calculate_entropy {
    my ($file) = @_;
    open my $fh, '<', $file or die "Could not open $file: $!";
    my %freq;
    my $total_chars = 0;

    while (my $char = getc($fh)) {
        $freq{$char}++;
        $total_chars++;
    }
    close $fh;

    my $entropy = 0;
    foreach my $count (values %freq) {
        my $p = $count / $total_chars;
        $entropy -= $p * log($p) / log(2);
    }

    return $entropy;
}

# Iterate over all .txt files in the current directory
foreach my $file (<*.txt>) {
    my $entropy = calculate_entropy($file);
    if ($entropy < $entropy_threshold) {
        print "Removing $file with entropy $entropy\n";
        unlink $file or warn "Could not unlink $file: $!";
    } else {
        print "Keeping $file with entropy $entropy\n";
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Calculate Entropy**: The `calculate_entropy` function reads a file character by character, counts the frequency of each character, and calculates the entropy using the formula:
   \[
   H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i)
   \]
   where \( p(x_i) \) is the probability of character \( x_i \).

2. **Threshold**: The script uses an entropy threshold (`$entropy_threshold`) to decide whether to keep or remove a file. You can adjust this threshold based on your specific needs.

3. **File Iteration**: The script iterates over all `.txt` files in the current directory, calculates their entropy, and removes files with entropy below the threshold.

### Running the Script:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `clean_by_entropy.pl`.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x clean_by_entropy.pl`.
3. Run the script: `./clean_by_entropy.pl`.

This approach provides a practical way to approximate the complexity of text files using entropy and clean unwanted files based on a complexity threshold. Adjust the entropy threshold to fit the specific characteristics of your corpus and the desired level of complexity for your RAG system.


This Perl script is a utility for identifying and optionally deleting text files in a specified directory (or its subdirectories) based on their entropy. Here's an explanation of its components and functionality:

### Key Functionalities:
1. **Calculate File Entropy**:
   - Entropy is a measure of randomness or information density in a file.
   - Files with low entropy (less randomness) are likely to be less meaningful or highly repetitive (e.g., empty, very simple, or redundant data).

2. **User Input**:
   - The script prompts the user for a target directory.
   - The user decides whether to search the directory recursively, including subdirectories.

3. **File Filtering and Processing**:
   - It scans the specified directory (and optionally subdirectories) for `.txt` files.
   - For each `.txt` file, it computes entropy using the `calculate_entropy` subroutine.

4. **Low-Entropy File Collection**:
   - Files with entropy below a specified threshold (`$entropy_threshold`, set to `3.5` by default) are marked for potential removal.
   - It keeps track of these files and their sizes to calculate the total size of files flagged for deletion.

5. **User Confirmation and Deletion**:
   - If low-entropy files are found, the script lists them with their entropy and size.
   - It asks the user for confirmation before deleting the files.
   - Upon confirmation, the files are deleted. Otherwise, the operation is aborted.

---

### Script Breakdown:

#### 1. **Entropy Calculation (`calculate_entropy`)**:
- Reads the file character by character.
- Computes the frequency of each character.
- Calculates entropy based on the Shannon entropy formula:
  \[
  \text{Entropy} = - \sum p_i \log_2(p_i)
  \]
  where \( p_i \) is the probability of each character.

#### 2. **Directory Traversal**:
- If the user chooses recursive search, it uses the `File::Find` module to walk through all files and subdirectories.
- Otherwise, it lists files in the target directory using `opendir`.

#### 3. **File Filtering**:
- Only processes files with a `.txt` extension.
- Ignores directories (`-f` ensures it is a file).

#### 4. **Low-Entropy File Collection**:
- Maintains an array of files to be removed, storing:
  - File path
  - Calculated entropy
  - File size (in bytes)

#### 5. **Interaction and Deletion**:
- Displays the list of low-entropy files and the total size.
- Prompts the user for confirmation.
- Deletes the files if the user agrees.

### Example Workflow:
1. **Prompt for Input**:
   - Enter directory: `/home/user/documents`
   - Recursive search: `y`

2. **Process Files**:
   - Scans `/home/user/documents` and all subdirectories for `.txt` files.
   - Computes entropy for each file.

3. **Display Results**:
   - Lists files with entropy < 3.5 and their sizes:
     ```
     Files to be removed:
     File: /home/user/documents/file1.txt    Entropy: 2.3       Size: 1200 bytes
     File: /home/user/documents/subdir/file2.txt Entropy: 1.9   Size: 2500 bytes
     Total size to be removed: 3700 bytes
     ```

4. **Confirmation**:
   - User decides whether to delete the files.
   - If `yes`, files are deleted.

5. **Output**:
   - Prints confirmation of deletion or message stating the operation was aborted.

---

### Practical Use Case:
- Cleaning directories by removing redundant or low-value text files, such as log files with repetitive patterns or empty content.

### Customization:
- Adjust `$entropy_threshold` for different levels of randomness.
- Modify file types to process (currently `.txt` files) as needed.
